1. What is polymorphism ??

Poly means many or several.
morphism means forms

java is OOPS based which means object oriented.

Executing :

multiple methods in more than one forms.
task implemented in more than one ways.

In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types: 

>> Compile-time Polymorphism -- Method Overloading
A method can have a same name but can also have multiple parameters or functions inside of them this is called method overloading.
we overload the method with different parameters or functions


>> Runtime Polymorphism -- Method overriding
We use it in POM, Util class, POJO Class -- We use the methods from a different class in one class by extending

- We override a method's function or logic from one parent class to a different child class.
- Overriding parent class method with the child class method.
- @Override annotation will be shown in the new method created in the second class or child class.
- When we run the same method in the child class it will execute child class the method
